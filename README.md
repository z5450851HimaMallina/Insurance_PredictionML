## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance business decision-making. By analyzing real-world datasets, the goal is to develop predictive models that provide actionable insights for business operations. The primary objective is to improve model performance, business interpretability, and generalizability to future data.

## Business Problem
Organizations increasingly rely on data-driven decision-making to optimize operations and improve customer experience. This project explores the following business case:
- **Medical Insurance Claims Prediction**: Estimating claim costs based on patient demographics and medical history.

## Data Sources
1. **Insurance Company Dataset**: Medical cost prediction dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).

## Approach
Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models to optimize prediction accuracy and business interpretability. The following steps were undertaken:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Feature engineering and selection to improve model relevance.
- Scaled numerical features and encoded categorical variables.

### 2. Model Development
Experimented with different machine learning models, ensuring a balance between accuracy and business applicability.

Regression Models Used:
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Stacking Regressor
Neural Network (NLP Regressor)

Model Evaluation Metrics Used: 
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R² Score
Median Absolute Error
Results & Insights : Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models performed the best with high R² scores and low error metrics.

### 3. Model Optimization
To improve model performance, applied:
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using `GridSearchCV`.
- **Feature selection** using `SelectKBest` and recursive feature elimination (RFE).
- **Regularization techniques** (L1/L2) for regression models.
- **Cross-validation** to ensure robustness and generalizability.
